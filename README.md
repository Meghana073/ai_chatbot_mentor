# ai_chatbot_mentor
AI Chatbot Mentor is a smart, interactive mentoring application developed to provide 
focused learning assistance within a single technical domain at a time. 
Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots that answer anything and everything, this system 
enforces strict domain boundaries, ensuring learners receive accurate, relevant, and 
distraction-free guidance. 
The application is built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience and LangChain to 
manage prompt logic, conversation flow, and domain restriction.

objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-powered mentor 
that: 
1.Guides learners only within the selected subject 
2.Prevents irrelevant or out-of-scope responses 
3.Maintains session-based conversation context 
4.Allows users to download the complete mentoring conversation for later use
